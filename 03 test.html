            <h1>Declaration of Independence</h1>
            <p>When in the Course of human events, it <strong>becomes necessary</strong> for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, <em>and</em> to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Natures God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. </p>
        <h2>When was it signed?</h2>
        <p>The Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776.</p>
